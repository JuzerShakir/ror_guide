### Setup PostgreSQL Credentials

To successfully create development and test database, you will need to update `config.database.yml` file with correct postgresql username and password.

There are multiple ways of passing it, we can either use ENV or Rails Credentials:

#### With ENV

There are multiple ways of creating it:

1. With Bash/ZSH
2. With Figaro Gem
3. Or Manually loading ENV hash keys.

For this project I have used the first option but you're open to choose any you see fit. You can refer to [this guide](http://railsapps.github.io/rails-environment-variables.html) to learn more about these options.

#### With Rails Credentials

```bash
EDITOR="code --wait" rails credentials:edit
```

_`code` for Visual Studio Code_
_`subl` for sublime_

This will open `credential.yml` file, now enter your credential as follows:

```
database:
  username: your_username
  password: your_password
```

Hit `ctrl + s` to save and then close the `credential.yml` file from the editor. This will save the credentials. To check if it was a success, run the following inside the rails console:

```
Rails.application.credentials.dig(:database, :username)
```

Now, inside the `database.yml` file give the following values to the credential keys:

```yml
username: <%= Rails.application.credentials.dig(:database, :username) %>
password: <%= Rails.application.credentials.dig(:database, :password) %>
```

Once you have setup your database credentials, we can now create and setup the database:

```bash
rails db:setup
```

Initiate the server:

```bash
rails s
```
